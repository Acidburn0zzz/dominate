About
=====

These tests are designed to ensure each module is behaving as it is expected.
Currently most of the tests were designed to highlight problems with existing
code but more are being added as development continues.


Usage
=====

To run the test suite simply execute `python test.py` and it will iterate
through the tests for each module.

You can also run only the tests for a single module by passing its name as
an argument (i.e. `python test.py pyy.html`).
